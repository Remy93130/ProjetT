						It is believed that a Gallic tribe called the Parisii lived on what is now called the Ile de la Cité since 250 BC. Nowadays, due to convincing archaeological evidence,  
						no Gallic vestige, or even any trace of occupation prior to the Roman conquest having been discovered on the island,  the histoiriens think maybe the Parisii had actually 
						settled their settlement further than the Île de la Cité. Since much of the Île de laCité was destroyed and rebuilt over time, archaeologists discovered, under the 
						gallo-romain level, an older level, not so spectacular although it is real (nails, post holes, remains of trash pits). The Île de la Cité stretched previously only 9 hectares, 
						instead of 17 today. We suppose that a few islets were added only later.
					</p>
					<div id="antiquite_plus" class="collapse histoire2"> 
					<p>
						In 52 BC., next to the Jules Cesar’s victory against Vercingetorix, we see the birth of the Lutece. Galtics settled on the island and continued to live from the river, thanks fishing, 
						while the gallo-romain city was built on the left bank. In Roman times, the Île de la cité enable a strategic supervision of the traffic and the river trade which makes the prosperity 
						of the boatmen of the Seine. But the city itself extends almost exclusively on the left bank of the river. The only two wooden bridges to serve the island during the Gallo-Roman and 
						then Merovingian periods until the middle of the 9th century were at the current location of the little bridge and Notre Dame bridge. Around the year 200, the barbarian invasions force 
						the Parisian population to take refuge on this island which is naturally protected by the Seine.
					</p>
					<p>
						Around the year 300. The island becomes the new center of the city welcoming most of its population, while the left bank, less secure, is partly abandoned. A reorganization of urban 
						structures begins with the construction of a rampart (between 308 and 360), made with large blocks of stone, architectural fragments from the great buildings of the left bank 
						(forum, amphitheater, necropolis, etc.).Large public and official buildings appear, also using stone blocks from the old buildings. In the western part of the island there is a 
						large building, probably of a military character and the place of the imperial residence, it is the palace, which is the seat of the governors and which also houses the Court of the 
						Praetorium. Two military emperors have resided there: Julian (Caesar in Gaul from 355 to 361, and emperor from 361 to 363) then Valentinian I (364-378) from 365 to 366. Connected to 
						the palace, a basilica is raised on the site of the current flower market. Measuring no less than 70 m long and 35 m wide, it is one of the greatest monuments of Gaul. After being 
						called Lutetia apud Parisios some time, it is from about 310 that Lutèce gradually takes the name of Civitas Parisiorum or Urbs Parisiorum then, by force of abbreviation, simply Paris.

						Around the year 508, while Clovis reigns since 481, he makes Paris the capital of the kingdom of the Franks and the old Gallo-Roman fortress, his personal residence. At this moment,
						the island of the city is the city; the word of Cite is then necessary to designate only this island. The palace then becomes the castle of the Merovingian kings. In favor of Christianization,
						churches are multiplying on the island and a basilica dedicated to Saint-Étienne is soon built partly on the site of the future Notre-Dame cathedral.

					<div id="moyen_age_plus" class="collapse histoire2">

						Dagobert creates a monetary workshop during his reign from 629 to 639. There are still coins bearing the inscription Palati Moneta and representing St. Eloi, the finance minister of the time.
						From Charlemagne, which reigned from 768 to 814, the city lost its status as capital. The centers of power of the new dynasty are mainly established in Italy, at Rome. The bishops of Paris then 
						become the masters of the island, It is well during the Middle Ages that the Ile de la Cité sees its great monuments and bridges, very famous today to be built.
					</p> 
					<p> 
						During the reign of Charle the bald, grandson of Charlemagne, from 843 to 877 is built a large bridge on the site of the current Pont-au-Change. There are also two large towers on the banks, 
						the Petit and the Grand Châtelet, to protect the access to the bridges, whose stacks are tightened to better control the passage of boats. Because the island has known Norman looting 
						between 845 and 861.
					</p>
					<p>
						The abbeys on both banks have churches built on the island (often on the site of smaller chapels), to shelter treasures and precious relics: Saint-Germain-le-Vieux is thus erected,
						Sainte-Geneviève-la-Petite, Saint-Landry-des-Arcis, and Saint-Barthélemy in the 10th century.
					</p>
					<p>
						The two bridges of the City are once again destroyed. The Grand-Pont is rebuilt further west while the Petit-Pont is rebuilt in the same location lined with houses and shops. On the old 
						piers of the Grand Pont is built Pont-aux-Meuniers, consisting of a row of mills. It was doubled in 1142 by the Pont-aux-Changeurs, which then took the name of Grand-Pont. Paris is then 
						a tripartite city with the city in its center, the rest of the agglomeration being distributed between the bet that connects the small bridge and the one that connects the great bridge 
						On the order of Maurice de Sully, bishop since 1160, We are beginning to replace the old Saint-Etienne Merovingian cathedral, which has become too small for a growing population, with a 
						much larger construction, the Notre-Dame cathedral, in a new style: Gothic. Cloister houses too close to the site are demolished and a new street, Rue Neuve-Notre-Dame, is pierced along 
						the axis of the new church to facilitate the transportation of materials.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1182, the choir was completed and the main altar was consecrated on May 19th. However, many other shrines still occupy this same part of the City. Together with the cathedral, Maurice 
						de Sully is rebuilding the palace, south of Notre-Dame. In 1185, the Petit-Pont is rebuilt by decision of Bishop Maurice de Sully. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, the island 
						has no less than twelve parish churches: Saint-Barthélémy, Saint-Pierre-des-Arcis, St. Eloi, St. Croix, Saint-Germain-le-Vieux, Sainte-Geneviève-la -Small, Saint-Denis-de-la-Châtre, 
						St. Mary Magdalene, Saint-Landry, St. Marine, St. Peter-aux-oxes, St. Christopher The Holy Chapel was built from 1242 to 1248 on request of Saint Louis instead of the old chapel of 
						St. Nicholas, The Conciergerie was started shortly before 1300 and completed before 1315. The construction of the Saint Michel Bridge spreads from 1379 to 1387. It is washed away by the 
						Seine in 1404, only 17 years later Between 1394 and 1406, Charles VI (1380-1422) built a new wooden bridge, the little bridge. 
						Carried in turn by January 31, 1408, it is restored in stone the following year and remains until the seventeenth century. May 30, 1413, it is still Charles VI who baptizes the new bridge 
						of Notre-Dame, solid work of wood connecting the island of the City to the street Saint-Martin on seventeen rows of piles.

She is particularly interested in sculpture, painting and the art of stained glass : it is its huge original stained glass windows that make today the wealth of the Holy Chapel, because it was deprived of its relics to the French Revolution, and thus lost its main reason for being.. In 1797, it was turned into an archive depot of the courthouse, and the expansion of it threatened his very existence. His rescue was decided in 1836 under the pressure of public opinion, and its restoration is launched a year later and lasts twenty-six years. As an emblematic building of the radiant Gothic style, the Sainte-Chapelle is classified as a historical monument by list of 1862, a year before the completion of his restoration, which is one of the most successful of his time. his does not prevent that because of its poor condition in 1836, the monument that we see today is essentially a monument of the nineteenth century.

					Notre-Dame Bridge is, as its name suggests, a bridge to access the Notre-Dame district by
					connecting the quai of Gesvres to the quay of Corsica on the Ile de la Cité. It is 105 meters long and 20 meters wide.
					It occupies the site of one of the very first bridges of the capital: the "Grand-Pont",
					replaced by the "boards of Milbray" and finally the current one.

						Many bridges have been at its location before, the current one was built from 1910 to 1914 and carried out by the engineer Jean Résal.
						It originally had five arches, but having become very dangerous for navigation, its number was reduced to three in 1912,
						including a central metal arch of 60 meters.

					The bridge bears this name because the toll for crossing the first bridge at this location was two deniers,
					the basic currency of the Roman monetary system. It connects the 4th arrondissement to the 5th. It is 45 meters long
					and 20 meters wide. Its construction was made from 1881 to 1883 and the architects are Henri-Prosper Bernard and Jules Lax.

						The bridge is made of cast iron but in reality it was simply redone, because this bridge exists

					The Saint Michel Bridge was built in 1857 at the request of Napoleon III by the engineers Vaudrey de la Galisserie.
					It connects the Ile de la Cité to the left bank by the Place Saint Michel.
					This name was given to him because the bridge is very close to the Sainte Chapelle. It is 62 meters long and 30 meters wide.

						The bridge originally built in 1378 was rebuilt several times, most recently in 1857.
						The bridge was made of wood and then, after its destruction, in stone. Today the bridge is stone and it has three arches.
						Above each pile an "N" engraved, reminiscent of the imperial emblem of Napoleon III.
